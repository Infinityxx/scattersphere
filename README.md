Scattersphere is a lightweight job coordination API designed to run a simple 
[DAG of tasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).

It is inspired by many projects on Github such as Orchestra, Chronos, Cats IO, 
Monix Task, and others.  It is designed to be self-contained, and extensible.
