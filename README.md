# Scattersphere: Job Coordination Server for Distributed Tasks

Scattersphere is a lightweight job coordination server designed to run a simple
DAG of tasks.  It is inspired by many projects on Github such as Orchestra, Chronos,
and others, however, it is designed to be self-contained, and extensible.
